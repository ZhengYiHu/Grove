### Jam

Lamp maze was a game made for the [**Brackeys Game Jam 2021.1**](https://itch.io/jam/brackeys-5) game jam by me an a friend that goes by the name of --**Victime**--

The Game page can be found [**HERE**](https://bards-yard.itch.io/lamp-maze).
We placed --**#45**-- out of --**#1881**-- total entries, witch is a truly unexpected result for both of us given that it was our first ever game jam.

### Theme and Brainstroming

The theme of the jam was --**Stronger together**-- witch made us explore many ideas with minions following the main character similiarly to the --**Pikmin**-- series.
We ultimately settled, due to the limited time, on the main mechanic inspired by --**Battle Pyramid**-- from Pokemon Emerald's --**Battle Frontier**-- where the player must orient himself in a --**dark maze**--, and the lighted area will gradually expand after each enemy defeated.
To better fit for the jam's theme, we made that the player must collect all the lamps scattered across the maze, ultimatley ending up with a small army of lamps with each lamp friend expanding the light circle.

### Mechanics

--**Eni**--, the main character, has the ability to unleash a --**shockwave**-- to the mouse location to turn on dormant --**Lamp friends**-- and levers.


Lamps that are turned on will the follow the player and grand extra light to orient better in the darkness that is the maze.

The final goal is to collect all the lost Lamps to turn on the --**Giant lightbulb**-- and give light back to the maze.
