### Projects

During my time at **[Playwind Games](https://www.playwindgames.com)** I had the privilege to work on a wide variety of games in different stages of development. From bigger projects like **[City Boom](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playwindgames.cityboomglobal)** to leaner Hypercasual games like **[Super Store Sort](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.playwindgames.superstore)**, I had the chance to familiarize with --**integrating**-- onto existing well established code bases as well as **--designing and implementing--** new and robust systems from the ground up for new games.
