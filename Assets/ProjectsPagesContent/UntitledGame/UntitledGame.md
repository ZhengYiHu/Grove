### Inspiration

I recently played a game [**A short hike**](https://adamgryu.itch.io/a-short-hike) by --**Adamgryu**-- that quickly became one of my all time favourites.
The chill and cozy vibes the game infuses were a refreshing breeze for me since in the latest years the dominant genre of games I was exposed to were mostly highly competitive and not so much about having a good time anymore.

--**Animal crossing**-- was another big inspiration, and the more I dived into the genre, the more games both released and in development I could find on the internet.

### Artstyle

My not so optimal approach to the development process suggested me to start to work on the artstyle and focus on that before even designing a proper game loop and core mechanics... which made sense to me at the time since the main motivation was to --capture the feelings-- of pleasure and --coziness-- to contrast the stressful routines I was stucked into. 

### Downfall

By --not having a defined idea in mind-- and just working on a single aspect of the game made me lose control on what the game should even be about.
I was spending months developing mechanics, not to reach some result I wanted the game to become, but only because --*I might need it in the future*--, so that I started learning and working on generic game mechanics like movements, physics, dialogue systems and so on... 


My developments approach made me quickly --lose interest-- on the project, and this is the --mains lesson-- learn from this project.
I wouldn't consider it a failure though since I learned *Soooo Much* during the whole development process since it was the first game I was really putting a lot of effort in.

For now I will probably halt the development, but who knows when I will get to pull it back out from the archives...
